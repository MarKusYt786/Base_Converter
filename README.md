# 🧠 Base Converter
The Number Base Converter Project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to convert numbers between different number bases, including binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal. This project aims to provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to input a value and select the base to convert from and to, making it easier to understand and work with different number systems. The core features of this project include a user-friendly GUI, multiple base conversion options, and a simple yet effective design.

## 🚀 Features
- **Multiple Base Conversion**: Convert numbers between binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal bases.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: A simple and intuitive interface for users to input values and select base conversion options.
- **Reset and Backspace Functions**: Easily reset the input field or perform backspace operations.
- **Conversion Functions**: Includes functions for converting between different number bases, such as `bin_to_bin`, `bin_to_dec`, `bin_to_oct`, `bin_to_hex`, and others.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: `tkinter` library for creating the GUI application.
- **Backend**: Python for handling user interactions and performing base conversions.
- **Dependencies**: `messagebox` module from `tkinter` for potential future use.
- **Build Tools**: None required for this project.
